While we encourage you to use a list of domains based on your users, we have included a minimal set of default domains.

This list, which will be improved over time, contains popular domains which you can use with Mailcheck as well.

```javascript
var domains = ["yahoo.com", "google.com", "hotmail.com", "gmail.com", "me.com", "aol.com", "mac.com",
"live.com", "comcast.net", "googlemail.com", "msn.com", "hotmail.co.uk", "yahoo.co.uk", "facebook.com", 
"verizon.net", "sbcglobal.net", "att.net", "gmx.com", "mail.com", "btinternet.com", "virginmedia.com", 
"blueyonder.co.uk", "ntlworld.com", "virgin.net", "tiscali.co.uk", "talktalk.co.uk", "sky.com", "orange.net", 
"wanadoo.co.uk", "freeserve.co.uk", "o2.co.uk", "gmx.de", "mail.ru", "gmx.net", "sina.com"];
